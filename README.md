Automated Python MD Simulation Pipeline

Example input file: exampleScript.txt

Example use: python headcontroller.py exampleScript.txt

Purpose of this project is to entirely automate the mass launching of jobs (also complex tasks such as umbrella sampling) in a programmatically sensible manner. 

Results:
Easily able to launch hundreds of jobs within seconds.
Personally improved productivity greatly as more resources could be spent on hands on analysis of data.
