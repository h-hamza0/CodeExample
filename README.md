Automated Python MD Simulation Pipeline

Example input file: exampleScript.txt

Purpose of this project is to entirely automate the mass launching of jobs (also complex tasks such as umbrella sampling) in a programmatically sensible manner. 

Results:
Easily able to launch hundreds of jobs within seconds.
Personally improved productivity greatly as more resources could be spent on hands on analysis of data. 

Currently improving:
Greater documentation
Better error handling [Currently, only a cyclization mechanism is in place]
Reduce the amount of fixed file paths, adaptive file finding [example: ions.mdp is a fixed file path. But this file path is akin to an installation file path and does not move]
